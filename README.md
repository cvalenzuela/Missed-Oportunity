# Missed Opportunity

Forced labor occurs when people are coerced to work through violence, intimidation, and in more subtle ways. Many workers are forced to stay in their jobs so they can pay off hefty recruitment fees. Some migrant workers have their identity papers confiscated by their employer, or are threatened with deportation if they attempt to assert their rights.

The U.S. federal government is the largest single purchaser in the global economy, with annual procurement spending that totals between US $450 and $500 billion. Many of the products it procures are produced using global supply chains, by laborers in foreign countries.

This is a data driven storytelling about the U.S. Government Purchases and Forced Labor Abroad.
