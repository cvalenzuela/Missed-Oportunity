    content: {

    title: 'Chapter Three: The Role of the U.S. Government',
    content: {
      1: 'The U.S. federal government is the largest single purchaser in the global economy, with annual procurement spending that totals between US $450 and $500 billion. Many of the products it procures are produced using global supply chains, by laborers in foreign countries.',
      2: 'Given this amount of purchases, it is inevitable that concerns over human rights abuses, including forced labor, will arise in some of these supply chains.',
      3: 'Defense-related spending constitutes the single largest type of procurement for the U.S. government.'

    title: 'Chapter Five: The FAR',
    content: {
      1: 'The U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) lays out the rules for government procurement. These rules include prohibitions on purchasing goods produced by forced or indentured labor, child labor or victims of human trafficking.',
      2: 'In August 2007, the U.S. government adopted standards meant to ban the purchase of goods involving forced labor at any point in the supply chain.',
      3: 'We can analyze the extent to which the government implements the FAR’s rules using its own data on the contractors it bans from receiving government contracts.'

    title: 'Chapter Six: What Can the Government Do, Anyway?',
    content: {
      1: 'Since some materials for weapons are sourced abroad, and more than 70,000 foreign nationals are employed on U.S. military bases, it is unlikely that U.S. military purchases have never involved forced labor. Nonetheless, the data the government provides to the public does not list any restrictions for violations of rules related to forced labor or human trafficking. This either means that the government is not regularly implementing it\'s own rules, or that it is not providing public and transparent information on when it does.',
      2: 'The U.S. government can use its purchasing power to promote positive labor standards around the world. While it cannot oversee all aspects of supply chains related to its purchases, it can give teeth to some of the FAR’s stronger rules by implementing them more regularly, and by reporting on that implementation in its relevant public databases. This would send a message to suppliers around the world that if they want to have the world’s biggest purchaser as a customer, they need to shape up.',
